# CanaryCareDataAnalysis
Some R code to analyse data from a Canary Care home monitoring system (https://www.canarycare.co.uk/).

It is useful to accumulate data day by day to build up a picture of movements throughout the day in order to set alarms for unusual behaviour.

Included an example anonymised dataset.
